    "section": "",
    "text": "NFL playcalling is an art form. All plays in the NFL are designed carefully and drilled to be executed with meticulous precision. Some of these plays occupy a sacred space in not just the execution but also the mythos of the game: a game sealing sack, an explosive run play, a laser throw locked onto the glory of a breathtaking win. Few types of plays occupy such a vaunted postition in the pantheon of football gameplay like interceptions do. One interception can reverse momentum of a game, sealing a a comeback win. Or it can pull the hopes and dreams of a win out of the air and into the arms of the opposing team. Thus, interceptions are the holy grail of defensive plays, and NFL teams have been on a decades long crusade to try and take the ball away as much as they can. Someting I have always wondered was how influential having a ball hawk player was in helping a team take the ball away as a whole. In this post we will go over a quick tuturial of how to doa quick EDA with data from a small sample of seasons, comparing NFL teams that led the league in interceptions and how many players on their team were in the top 5 that season in terms of incercpetion numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear (regular season only)\nTeam\ntotal team INT\n# of Players in Top 5 for invidual INT\n\n\n\n\n2024\nVikings\n24\n1\n\n\n\nTexans\n19\n2\n\n\n\nSteelers\n17\n2\n\n\n\nPackers\n17\n1\n\n\n\nBills\n16\n0\n\n\n\nLions\n16\n2\n\n\n2023\nBrowns\n23\n1\n\n\n\nPatriots\n21\n0\n\n\n\nCommanders\n21\n0\n\n\n\nVikings\n19\n0\n\n\n\nBills\n18\n1\n\n\n\nRaiders\n18\n0\n\n\n2022\nColts\n20\n1\n\n\n\nTexans\n19\n1\n\n\n\nCowboys\n18\n1\n\n\n\nCardinals\n17\n0\n\n\n\nRaiders\n17\n0\n\n\n\nCommanders\n16\n1\n\n\n2021\nPanthers\n21\n0\n\n\n\nGiants\n20\n2\n\n\n\nBears\n20\n0\n\n\n\nJets\n20\n0\n\n\n\nRams\n18\n1\n\n\n\nRavens\n18\n0\n\n\n2020\nDolphins\n18\n1\n\n\n\nSteelers\n18\n1\n\n\n\nPatriots\n18\n1\n\n\n\nSaints\n18\n0\n\n\n\nChiefs\n16\n1\n\n\n\nCommanders\n16\n1\n\n\n\nHere are the teams that led the NFL in total interceptions from the 2020 regular season to the 2024 regular season.
