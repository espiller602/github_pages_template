While this may seem surprising, there are several possible reasons for this:\n\nScheme\nThere are a variety of defensive coverages that modern NFL defenses use. These coverages dictate what players on the offense and defensive players are responsible for guarding, what areas of the field defensive players are responsible for covering/protecting, and how to react with other players on the defense to what plays the offense runs. A good scheme can create opportunities for interceptions even without ballhawks or elite coverage defenders.\n\n\nMistakes on offense\nOffenses also run complex play schemes. Players on the offense, especially the quarterback, must react to and try and read what schemes defenses are using before the play to try to move the ball downfield. ball catchers must run specific routes, and good catches depend on accurate throws from the quarterback as well as the receivers being at the right place in on the field at the right time. If the receiver makes a mistake and is not where the quarterback expects him to be, it’s easy to quickly throw the ball to a defensive back for an easy interception. If a ball is tipped in the air by another player or the receiver bobbles the ball or drops it, that creates opportunities for interceptions. Interceptions from tipped or bobbled balls are more a product of offensive errors, making them more random.\n\n\npash rush\nThe players on the defensive line are trying to sack the quarterback. If players on the defensive line are beating past the offesnive line and getting in the quarterbacks face and putting them under pressure, this makes the quarterback more likely to make quick, errant throws to get the ball out to avoid sacks and losing field position. A good pass rush, when combined with good schemes for the defensive players in the back field, are more likely to create opportunities for interceptions by forcing offenses to make more mistakes."

All of the data presented here was gathered from ESPN, which also has data on which teams and players led the league in sacks for a given year. Using the data from EPSN, add a column to the data frame we created for how many sacks the teams that led the league in interceptions had during the regular season for each year we covered. Perform the same analysis but with team INT and team sacks and see what kind of relationship, if any, exists between the two variables."
