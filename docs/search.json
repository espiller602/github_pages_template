    "text": "Richard Sherman’s iconic game-sealing pick\nNFL playcalling is an art form. All plays in the NFL are designed carefully and drilled to be executed with meticulous precision. Some of these plays occupy a sacred space in not just the execution but also the mythos of the game: a game-sealing sack, an explosive run play, a laser throw locked onto the glory of a breathtaking win. Few types of plays occupy such a vaunted position in the pantheon of football gameplay like interceptions do. One interception can reverse the momentum of a game, sealing a comeback win. Or it can pull the hopes and dreams of a win out of the air and into the arms of the opposing team. Thus, interceptions are the holy grail of defensive plays, and NFL teams have been on a decades-long crusade to try to take the ball away as much as they can. Something I have always wondered was how influential having a ball hawk player was in helping a team take the ball away as a whole. In this post, we will go over a quick tutorial on how to do a quick EDA with data from a small sample of seasons, comparing NFL teams that led the league in interceptions and how many players on their team were in the top 5 that season in terms of interception numbers.",

While this may seem surprising, there are several possible reasons for this:\n\nScheme\nThere are a variety of defensive coverages that modern NFL defenses use. These coverages dictate what players on the offense and defensive players are responsible for guarding, what areas of the field defensive players are responsible for covering/protecting, and how to react with other players on the defense to what plays the offense runs. A good scheme can create opportunities for interceptions even without ballhawks or elite coverage defenders.\n\n\nMistakes on offense\nOffenses also run complex play schemes. Players on the offense, especially the quarterback, must react to and try and read what schemes defenses are using before the play to try to move the ball downfield. ball catchers must run specific routes, and good catches depend on accurate throws from the quarterback as well as the receivers being at the right place in on the field at the right time. If the receiver makes a mistake and is not where the quarterback expects him to be, it’s easy to quickly throw the ball to a defensive back for an easy interception. If a ball is tipped in the air by another player or the receiver bobbles the ball or drops it, that creates opportunities for interceptions. Interceptions from tipped or bobbled balls are more a product of offensive errors, making them more random.\n\n\npass rush\nThe players on the defensive line are trying to sack the quarterback. If players on the defensive line are beating past the offensive line and getting in the quarterbacks face and putting them under pressure, this makes the quarterback more likely to make quick, errant throws to get the ball out to avoid sacks and losing field position. A good pass rush, when combined with good schemes for the defensive players in the back field, are more likely to create opportunities for interceptions by forcing offenses to make more mistakes.",

    "text": "Introduction\nAmerican Football has more moving parts than almost any other sport. Offense and Defense are separate groups of players. Within each of these are four to five different kinds of players who all have different roles on the field. Each Team has 11 on the field at a time. The sheer number of moving parts on one play, for both offense and defense, is immense. Using data on team offense from the 2018 to the 2024 seasons, I wanted to investigate how Net Passing Yards per attempt (Passing NY/A) and Rushing Yards per attempt (Rushing Y/A) have changed through this period and if there is any link between these metrics. I also wanted to know how teams that make the postseason perform in these metrics compared to the other teams in the league. This data is interesting because it can capture shifts in offensive tendencies over time and give insight into the tendencies of successful offensive teams.\nGathering the data was done using Pro-Football-Reference.com. This website does not allow any bot scraping for its football data, according to their robots.txt, but they do allow data to be downloaded for free. In order to obtain the data, I downloaded Excel files for the tables I wanted. However, the data was not actually stored as an Excel but as an HTML table. I used pandas to read the HTML from each file, which I stored in one folder. There were 14 files total: One that contained the teams that made it to the postseason for each season, and one that had offensive data in a variety of metrics, including passing NY/A and rushing Y/A for each team in a season. I combined the offensive data into one data set, adding columns to mark the season and which teams won a postseason game, which was taken from the postseason teams data sets for each season.\nThe final data set has 244 rows and 30 columns, representing various offensive metrics, including whether or not they won a playoff game, for all 32 teams from the 2018 to the 2024 season\n\n\nEDA overview\nThis table shows, for a given season, according to my analysis, how many of the teams that won at least one playoff game were above league average in both Passing NY/A and Rushing Y/A for a given season, or above average in just one or neither metric. Many teams that win playoff games are rather balanced. 2018 and 2021 are the only years in which less than 50% of teams that won at least one playoff game were above league average in both metrics simultaneously. Defensive schemes tend to become more aggressive in the playoffs, so balanced teams might have an advantage since they can rely on both to generate points (rather than being vulnerable to having either the passing or rushing attack completely limited by the defense, which forces them to rely on more inefficient offense).\n\n\n\nSeason\nPostseason Winners\nBoth\nPassing\nRushing\nNeither\n\n\n\n\n2018\n8\n3\n4\n1\n0\n\n\n2019\n7\n5\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n2020\n8\n4\n3\n1\n0\n\n\n2021\n6\n2\n4\n0\n0\n\n\n2022\n8\n5\n2\n1\n0\n\n\n2023\n8\n6\n2\n0\n0\n\n\n2024\n7\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n\n\n\npassing vs rushing over time\n\n\n\nPassing NY/A and Rushing Y/A from 2018-2024\n\n\nInterestingly, both passing NY/A and rushing Y/A didn’t fluctuate much across the seven-season sample. Looking at the overall and within-season standard deviations, we can confirm that neither metric varies by a significant amount. This could be due to a variety of reasons. The league is constantly adjusting to limit explosive plays, whether passing or running. Even above-average season outliers tend to regress towards the mean over multiple seasons in terms of their run and pass efficiency. Thus, given the constant evolution, not just offensively but defensively, the averages don’t change much due to this constant chess match between offenses and defenses.\n\n\nPer Season\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason\nPassing_NY/A Mean\nPassing_NY/A Std\nRushing_Y/A Mean\nRushing_Y/A Std\n\n\n\n\n2018\n6.400\n0.792\n4.419\n0.342\n\n\n2019\n6.306\n0.733\n4.284\n0.505\n\n\n2020\n6.431\n0.732\n4.384\n0.428\n\n\n2021\n6.225\n0.707\n4.306\n0.421\n\n\n2022\n6.116\n0.643\n4.434\n0.450\n\n\n2023\n6.063\n0.853\n4.175\n0.403\n\n\n2024\n6.247\n0.818\n4.406\n0.472\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross All Seasons\n\n\n\nMetric\nMean\nStd\n\n\n\n\nPassing_NY/A\n6.255\n0.757\n\n\nRushing_Y/A\n4.344\n0.437\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing NY/A and Rushing Y/A plotted for every team per season\n\n\n\nPassing NY/A and Rushing Y/A from 2018-2024\n\n\nHowever, the relationship between both passing NY/A and rushing Y/A per season varies more. This can also be seen in the scatter plots. Possible reasons for this could be the variance in the number of teams per season that are substantially above average in both metrics. More teams that are farther above average in both could inflate the slope of the lines in the scatterplots and the correlation coefficients, as well as some teams being outliers on how far above the average they are could also inflate the correlation in a given season. Except for 2024, which had an abnormal high correlation coefficient, correlation is generally low, suggesting teams may specialize in passing or rushing rather than excel at both.\n\n\nCorrelation Between Passing NY/A and Rushing Y/A\n\n\n\nSeason\nCorrelation\n\n\n\n\nOverall\n0.28\n\n\n2018\n0.23\n\n\n2019\n0.27\n\n\n2020\n0.15\n\n\n2021\n0.13\n\n\n2022\n0.15\n\n\n2023\n0.33\n\n\n2024\n0.58\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfurther info\nAll data gathered from Pro Football Reference.\nFor each season,the tables are found here https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/YEAR/#team_stats and https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/YEAR/#playoff_results, where YEAR is the actual year (insert the year you want to find into the links)\nAll code used to process, format, and analyze the data is here",
