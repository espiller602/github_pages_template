## Background
    I currently doing BS in Statistics (emphasis in Data Science) at BYU. I love using data to give insights about problems that impact people and finding ways to solve them. I am especially interested in using the power of data to advocate for medical patients to get the best care available to them. I have done research, data analysis and  data visualization for the BYU office of careers and experiential learning and helped with automation for the BYU Honors department.
